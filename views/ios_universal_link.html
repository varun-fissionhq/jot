          <img src="http://www.joyoftipping.com/assets/images/tips1.png" alt="" class="thmb"> A tip (also called a gratuity)
          is a sum of money customarily given by a client or customer to a service worker, in addition to the basic price.
          Tipping is commonly given to certain service sector workers for a service performed or anticipated. Depending on
          the country or location, it may be customary to tip servers in bars and restaurants, taxi drivers, hair stylists,
          and so on. <br><br> Tips and their amount are a matter of social custom and etiquette, and the custom varies between
          countries and settings. In some locations tipping is discouraged and considered insulting; while in some other
          locations tipping is expected from customers. The customary amount of a tip can be a specific range of monetary
          amounts or a certain percentage of the bill based on the perceived quality of the service given. Tipping is a custom
          and social etiquette in America. <br><br> Tipping is voluntary act, however, it is widely practiced here. Usually
          15% of the total amount is customary. One can present more if the service is really very good, or less if the service
          fails to provide satisfaction. There are certain countries where tipping is prohibited and the service provider
          will consider it insulting or will consider it as a bribe. In Japan, for example, does not have a culture of tipping,
          and it is considered insulting to the service provider. When it comes right down to it, tipping is really just
          an extra nice way to say "Thank you" to your service provider. It is meant to enhance the enjoyment of all parties
          in the transaction. Of course, calculating the amount a tip can be tricky. We created Joy of Tipping to help take
          some of the stress out of this. Give it a try. Download today!.
